Hello Team,

You guys established a well structured simulation of CHORD. Abstracting multiple nodes via workers is a nice technique.

Could have added multiple such workers(with some variations) and their abstractions to simulate distributed nature of CHORD.
Could have added bit more documentation for (Actor's recievers at least) and their actions.

That being said, good job with your simulation!

Your scores are Updated on BB! (You will see them when they are released)

Regards,
Mohammed Siddiq
